## General info

Project Goal: Send a rocket with a 200g payload to the moon.

Stages:

1. Build a rocket
2. Build a rocket with recoverable parts for relaunch
3. Build a 2 stage rocket
4. Build a 2 stage rocket with sensors and radio
5. Build an orbiter payload with a radio responder
6. Build a rocket with orbital payload.
7. Build a luna rocket.
8. Build a luna rocket with sensors and payload.
9. Build a rocket with example luna rocket payload for launch test.

## Technologies

App developed with:

Frontend Portal: React, JavaScript, Tailwind, Axios, validator

Backend Server: Express, Prisma, JavaScript, postgreSQL

Rocket Firmware: C/C++

Rocket Guidance: ??

## Server

A server to manage the portal data and users.
As well as any other sites or servers we require.

## Portal Frontend

Purpose:
Share data and designs between users.

### Run this project locally

1. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your machine.
2. Navigate to client and server files and run
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

## Projects

1. Rocket Design
2. Custom Display Apps
3. Circuit programming

### Circuitry

1. Gyroscope and Speed monitor - chip for arduino
2. Raspberry Pi Brain
3. Ignition controller
4. Radio Signal transmitter - ping a location and id signal - send data to ground control
5. Temperature sensor/s
6. Cameras and 360 view

### Applications

A number of windows applications we can run on laptops to monitor the rockets from launch.
Each will be a separate program to increase speed and less page navigation required.

1. Rocket monitoring - speed, height,
2. Rocket controls - overrides, deploy parachute, eject stage
3. Weather App - air flow at heights, temp
4. Air Traffic Monitoring - keep our airspace clear and for issues.
5. Camera feeds - multiple displays and recording for all cameras

## Things to consider

- Total weight of craft - keep a tally on the site
- Redundant control systems
- Weight of payload
- Launch location - close to equator = faster at launch

## Regulations

1. Launches of rocket motors under 160Ns are not required to inform air space control
   1. The height of this launch being around 1000ft
2. Launces of rocket motors between 160 and 10000Ns are required to notify air space CAA
   1. You must notify the air space
   2. You must do due diligence on the surrounding area
   3. You must prepare a flight plan
   4. You must have safety procedures in place.
   5. Technically there is no height limit just power limit.
